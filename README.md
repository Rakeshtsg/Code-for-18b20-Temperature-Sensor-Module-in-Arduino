# Code-for-18b20-Temperature-Sensor-Module-in-Arduino
The DS18B20 temperature sensor is a digital sensor that uses a 1-Wire interface to communicate with an Arduino board. The sensor is capable of measuring temperatures between -55 and 125 degrees Celsius with a resolution of 0.5 degrees.
In this code, the DS18B20 temperature sensor is connected to digital pin 2 and is accessed using the DallasTemperature library. The temperature is read and printed to the serial port, so you can view it using the Arduino serial monitor.
